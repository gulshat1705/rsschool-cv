### About Me
I am an economist by profession. In recent years I have been working as an accountant. During maternity leave I wanted to learn something new, and on the advice of a friend I decided to learn web development. I began to independently study html, css, I was very interested. But I was not confident in my skills in javascript and went back to accounting but continued to study web development. I have a very strong desire to enter the IT field, and every day I improve my skills in this area. I am interested in programming and want to develop in the IT field. I am hardworking, responsible. I treat any tasks very responsibly, I am persistent, I think in programming persistence and responsibility is the most important skill.
